# Architecture Overview

Puppet follows a plugin-based architecture where each menu can contain multiple plugins that generate and handle menu items. The application flow is designed to be modular and extensible through WASM plugins.

## Application Flow

1. **Menu Activation**
   - User triggers menu via configured hotkey
   - System loads associated plugins

2. **Plugin Initialization**
   - Each plugin's `init()` function is called with user-defined parameters
   - Plugins return initial menu items

3. **Menu Display**
   - Items are rendered in the chosen layout (wheel/list)
   - Visual theme and positioning are applied

4. **User Interaction**
   - User can filter items through text input
   - Plugins can update items via `filter(query)` method
   - Item selection triggers plugin's `on_selected()` handler

## Plugin Architecture

### Core Functions

Every plugin must implement three essential functions:

```typescript
// Initialize and return initial menu items
init(): List<{name: string, desc: string, icon: string}>

// Filter or update items based on user input
filter(query: string): List<{name: string, desc: string, icon: string}>

// Handle item selection
on_selected(selected: string): void
```

### Host Integration

Plugins can execute system commands using the provided host function:

```typescript
cli_run(command: string, args: string[]): string
```

### Plugin Data Access

- Each plugin has access to a dedicated `/data` directory for reading and writing
- Filesystem access requires `wasi: true` in manifest
- Paths specified in `allowedPaths` can include environment variables
- Host system command execution via `cli_run` function

## Configuration Architecture

### Menu Configuration
- Settings stored per menu
- Plugin-specific parameters
- Visual theme assignments
- Layout and positioning rules

### System Settings
- Global configuration options
- Default menu selection
- System-wide hotkeys
- Platform-specific settings
